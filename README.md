# Sense-Hat-Examples
Some of my own examples for the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT.

This might become a bit of a dumping ground for short projects and sample code, but I'll try to keep it as tidy as possible.

## Firework Display.
Firework.py is a script which allows you to have your very own firework display using the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT's LED display grid. This code could easily be adapted to suit other LED displays (I'd love to see it on a Ubercorn hat!).
